				<p>What does the sky look like? Don’t go outside, just guess. It’s exactly 6pm as I write this and I can tell that the sky probably 
					is palish orange around the sun and blue as I look away. Duh, big deal. But something interesting is happening here, 
					I don’t actually know what interactions are happening between individual particles up there; oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. 
					Even deeper, the electrons frantically orbiting around protons and neutrons, it goes on and on and on. 
					How is it possible that I can’t make sense of a single constituent particle, but I intuitively understand what business are trillions upon 
					trillions of them up to? It’s like I don’t get the concept of the alphabet in the English language but here I’m writing this blog. Isn’t it absurd? 
					Am I being weird to think that this is logically out of whack? This paradox comes up everywhere if you think about it. Using a smartphone is a breeze,
					even though for most of us it’s a black box, doing some black magic inside it.</p>
		
				<p>So what’s going on here?</p>
				
				<p>Well, We don’t really need every pixel worth of cat fur to recognize that it’s a cat, sitting on a kitchen top and about to drop a jar. 
					So we compress the videos and photos to share or stream them on demand. Just like we don’t need every single minute detail about a person to make 
					a quick judgment about whether to be friends with them or not. This makes me think that we actually don’t understand these things in isolation, 
					but we know how they behave in aggregate. I think you can guess where I’m going, there are certain patterns in nature that are quite salient and 
					we’re good at recognizing them, so we can get an intuitive sense without the need to process all the information around us.</p>
				
				<p>But what are some of the things we’re missing out on because we can’t even sense them?</p>
				
				<p>The other day I was watching some video on my phone and suddenly it hit me, that my phone and the wifi are communicating in the same way 
					light communicates information to us, the only difference is the wavelength. Let’s go through this journey together. Imagine yourself standing in 
					front of a huge landscape, filled with mountains of the same height that are lined up from your far left to right. Look to your left, there the 
					mountains are moderately steep and far apart, you could probably hike them. Now slowly pan your head towards the right, you see that the mountains 
					are gradually becoming steeper and thinner, and the space between them getting shorter and shorter. Think of The undulation of the mountains, 
					the peaks and valleys as a wave going up and down and up and down. What you’re looking at is the electromagnetic spectrum, the distance between one 
					mountain peak to another is the wavelength, and the light we see is only a tiny sliver of this huge swath of waveland. See what I did there?</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, where were we? Aah! light, wifi, and the brain. So light hits a surface, the surface absorbs some of it and reflects back the remaining, 
					some of that reflected light then hits the retina inside our eyes, cells get stimulated and transmit electrochemical signals that then travel to 
					the brain, the brain then makes sense of it — like right now, what you’re reading are just squiggly lines, they don’t mean anything. Until your brain 
					runs the algorithms you’ve fed into it to recognize the patterns, and induce meaning into them. Fascinating right? But I digress — and the final result 
					is what you see. Now similar principle applies to the communication between a phone and a wifi. Wifi transmits a signal in the shorter end of the 
					radio wave (a stretched out sibling of the light wave), the receiver inside the phone, well, receives it (just like the cells inside the eyes), 
					and the processor then decodes it and executes the instructions (just like the brain), and tada! I can stream my video. I know these are criminally 
					simplified explanations of what actually happens behind the scenes but you got the point. It is fundamentally the same, the exchange of information 
					via waves.</p>
				
				<p>You know evolution was pretty efficient, it only endowed us with the sensors we needed to survive. Even the sound we hear is just a small slice of a 
					wider dimension of the pressure waves. Look around you, The place you’re in is a bustling metropolis of all sorts of crazy and bizarre patterns of 
					waves zooming past you. But you don’t have the right hardware to sense them. That, until science enters the room, with its awesome gadgets, 
					to give us a peek inside the hidden world we live in. The manipulation of these waves is what connects our whole civilization.</p>
				
				<p>Actually, it’s quite humbling to think that there’s a lot more happening around us than meets the eye.</p>
				
				<p>Some three and a half months ago I became obsessed with learning calculus, and I’ve to say it was a damn good experience. 
					It made me think about things in ways I never would’ve thought to explore. Mathematics raises some really philosophical questions if you look past 
					the theorems and formulas, and really ponder about what it’s trying to say. I was studying “Conservative vector fields”. 
					They say, if a particle chooses a start and endpoint inside the vector field, and travels through it. It doesn’t matter what path it takes, 
					the effects of the vector field on the particle will always be the same. It can go to infinity and come back, it will make no difference. 
					The only thing that matters is the starting and ending point but wait!… That’s life! You are born, you live, you learn. You have some good, 
					some bad experiences. Some ups, some downs. One moment you’re miserable the other you’re in bliss. You go through the extremes of emotions. 
					But at the end of the day, we all are on a journey, surfing through the vector field we call life. No matter what path we take, 
					the endpoint is the same for all of us.</p>
				
				<p>While keeping up with your day-to-day rigmarole reading this might seem, “yeah, it is what it is” and I’m right there with you. But it matters, 
					it matters a lot. Because when we really see and understand these phenomena unfolding right in front of us deeply, it changes our perspective, 
					the way we look at things, it changes us. The joy I felt the first time I learned, why rainbows exist, why the rainbow I see is just made for me, 
					and no one else can see it the way I see or I can’t see it the way you see, was indescribable. We start to recognize these patterns, 
					these small things — that actually are profound — here and there, that we used to look at but never really saw. We find the tether from one aspect of life 
					to another. We connect the dots. The joy in these moments is what inspires me to learn, to see, to appreciate the things I never would’ve thought to pay 
					attention to. And my hope with all of this is to share some of the enthusiasm with you, dear reader. And I hope you enjoyed the time spent here, with me.</p>
